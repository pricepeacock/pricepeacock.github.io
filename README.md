Austin Coding Academy Midterm Project
I am replicating the Teysha.is website for my midterm project. I will be using HTML and CSS. Teysha is a certified B Corporation whose purpose is to connect people through art, community, and culture, and cultivate a more vibrant world. I chose to replicate Teysha's website because I'm inspired by their passion to partner with communities to bring more opportunities to the world by empowering artisans around the world.
